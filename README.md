# DataVault: Decentralized Personal Data Marketplace

## Project Overview

DataVault is a revolutionary platform that empowers individuals to securely monetize their personal data while maintaining complete privacy and control. By leveraging blockchain technology and advanced encryption, we create a transparent, secure, and ethical marketplace for personal data exchange.

## Core Principles
- **Individual Sovereignty**: Users have full control over their personal data
- **Transparent Monetization**: Fair compensation for data usage
- **Privacy-First Design**: Advanced encryption and anonymization techniques
- **Granular Access Control**: Precise permissions for data sharing

## Key Features

### 1. Secure Data Storage
- Decentralized storage on Stacks blockchain
- End-to-end encryption
- User-controlled encryption keys
- Distributed storage with redundancy
- Immutable data provenance tracking

### 2. Granular Access Control
- Blockchain-based smart contracts for precise data sharing permissions
- Configurable access levels:
    - View
    - Analyze
    - Temporary access
    - One-time usage
- Automatic revocation mechanisms
- Detailed access logging

### 3. Automated Micropayment System
- Instant, fractional payments for data usage
- Stacks blockchain transaction settlement
- Real-time earnings tracking
- Transparent fee structure
- Low-overhead micropayment mechanisms

### 4. Anonymized Data Analysis
- AI-powered anonymization techniques
- Differential privacy algorithms
- Statistical obfuscation
- Machine learning model integration
- Compliance with global privacy regulations

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
- Stacks blockchain for smart contract execution
